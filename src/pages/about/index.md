I recognized The Eye of the World the moment my mother put the book in my hands. I’d seen it before, in the hands of my arch nemesis. 

NEAL. 

Back in junior high, I was NOT one of the cool kids, but I was cooler than Neal; I was sure of it. I had to be. We were both voracious readers, the only kids in class who finished our work early so we could dig a dog-eared book from our backpacks and squeeze in a few pages before the teacher demanded our attention once again. But whereas I read Harry Potter, David Baldacci, Cornelia Funke, and other acceptable books, Neal read books with strange covers that nobody recognized beyond the observable fact that they were definitely not cool. Only Erika, much maligned for her Naruto keychains and penchant for doodling characters from Inuyasha, occupied a lower rung on the sacred social ladder. 

No, you didn’t leave something in the oven. That’s just the scent of irony and self-loathing wafting out at you from across the digital plane. 

The Eye of the World changed everything for me. I’d always been a hungry reader, helped in no small part by my mother who encouraged me by: 

A. Buying me books, and 

B. Never caring if my light was on after bedtime, so long as I was reading. 

Suddenly, I was voracious. I devoured The Wheel of Time, reading up to Knife of Dreams (this was back in 2008) and then started over. Back then, Googling “Top 100 Fantasy Books” did more than dredge up mountains of clickbait sewage. 

It was an education in the classics with a few new names like Sanderson and Rothfuss thrown in for good measure, and it informed my taste more than an undergraduate English reading list could ever dream of doing. I read all night, every night, never sleeping until I’d hit my goal of 250 pages before bed. Often I read more, much more. My record? Well, I don’t remember exactly, but it was somewhere in the mid 600’s. 

I had my first crack at writing sometime in 2010. My family had moved to Panama, and with less than 20 hrs of schoolwork a week on my plate and no friends to distract me, I was burdened with an amount of free time which still staggers me to recall. The writer I drew the most from at the time was Brandon Sanderson. He was two books into completing the Wheel of Time, and The Way of Kings had just been released. The Age of Sanderson had begun, and I was riding the wave. Monolith is a shameless Mistborn ripoff as heavily influenced by anime like Rurouni Kenshin, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Fullmetal Alchemist as it was by my cry-porn musical taste of the time, including one scene literally lifted from Regina Spektor’s “The Call.” 

Not exactly a recipe for success. 

In 2011, I served an LDS mission in Bolivia, and spent my free time filling a binder with stories and worldbuilding ideas. I still have this binder. Some of the ideas actually are shockingly good. Others, not so much. Moving on. 

2014 marked the beginning of a period of… uhhh… decreased output, let’s call it. In 2015 I wrote a short story called “Standard Procedure” for BYU-Idaho’s PPC writing contest which took 3rd place. You can find it in my portfolio. After that, I started and then immediately stalled on a cyberpunk project ripping off Eden! It’s an Endless World (not that anyone would have noticed, honestly). After that, I spent my time writing creative non-fiction essays and trying to convince myself that I’d graduated to higher intellectual realms. Fantasy was once again, uncool. 

You have my permission to cringe. 

But the Wheel of Time turns. A wind blew down from the Rocky Mountains, swirling the snowcapped peak of Timpanogos, and carrying with it the echoes of an age long past, an age yet to come. 

In 2018, I started writing again. Fantasy, just like the good old days. Nearing graduation, the smog was beginning to clear from my eyes. It was like I’d been in a trance. What was I thinking? I didn’t give a rip about creative non-fiction! Heck, I didn’t give a rip about NYT fiction or the Booker Prize or anything. While my classmates clogged their Goodsreads “To Read” lists with obscure essay collections and the latest from Zadie Smith, I was going through a renaissance. 

It’s 2021. Three years running (soon to be four), I’ve applied to and have been rejected from Brandon Sanderson’s writing class. In my most feverish, cheese addled dreams, this becomes my version of Michael Jordan getting cut from his high school team. The truth, I’m probably just not that good yet. But that’s okay. I’m a writer, and I write. If I get published, and people read my stuff, that would be awesome. Nothing would make me happier. But if it happens, it’ll be because I was writing for myself first. 

Corny poster fodder dispensed with, here’s some good stuff. It’s me, reflections of me gathered into a handy list which, hopefully, says enough about me to make any future attempts at a psychoanalytical biography wholly redundant.
