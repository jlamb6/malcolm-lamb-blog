    Poke around my portfolio! There, you'll find all the writing I'm not ashamed
    of, essays, short stories, and excerpts from my novels (excluding the one
    from high school that we don't talk about). 

    To keep up with my writing, follow this link where I post chapters of my current project as I write it!

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
