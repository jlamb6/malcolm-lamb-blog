    writing, review Romance/Sci-Fi/Fantasy books, and rant like a maniac about
    anything that frustrates errr... interests me. And if that doesn't scare you
    off, feel free to poke around in my portfolio. There, you'll find short
    stories, essays, excerpts from my novels and a link to my current project so
    you can read as I write! "

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
