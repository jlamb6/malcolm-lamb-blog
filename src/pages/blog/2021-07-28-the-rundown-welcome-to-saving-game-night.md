It almost seems presumptuous to begin my blog with an introduction. After all, doing so assumes that people who don’t already know who I am will ever read anything I’ve written here, much less care about Malcolm Lamb, the person. In an ideal timeline, the kind which I rarely have the guts to even consider, a post like this will one day be looked back on as my “humble beginnings.” Fans (though I’ll gladly settle for readers) of my books will read these words and say to themselves, “Wow. Look where this guy started off? Twenty-eight years old and only one completed book. Who would have thought he’d become what he did?” 

Hey, a guy can dream, can’t he? 

So, Saving Game Night. Not the most optimized title for a blog, is it? That would have been something… well, else. Hey, I don’t know anything about SEO, cut me some slack. Funnily enough, it’s not even my preferred title. That would be In-Between Frames. In-between frames, for those who don’t know, is a term used in animation. After the key frames are drawn, in-between frames fill in the gaps. Without them, a show like Avatar the Last Airbender would be only a powerpoint presentation. In-between frames add life and motion. Do you see where I’m going with this? My books would have been the key frames, a picture of me as an author, while my blogging would have filled in the gaps and offered a more rounded picture. 

Yeah, I thought it was a little pretentious too. 

Saving Game Night is better. It’s unassuming, somewhat clever, and more accurate to boot. My poor wife has suffered through enough game nights and social situations ruined because someone said something that instigated an unsolicited Malcolm rant. You see, I’ve always been… passionate about the things I like, to the point that I’m often an outsider even within the communities surrounding those things. 

Example A: Baseball. Plenty of people like baseball, but only a select few have spent hundreds of hours on Fangraphs and Baseball Reference, diving through advanced stats. Some poor soul might make an offhand comment about a player only to get an earful of, “Well actually…” It’s not pretty. The same goes for basically everything else that I’m interested in, be it books, anime, movies, music, yada yada yada. You get the picture. I’m a crazy person. Moving on. 

Rest assured, I have other content in mind which I’m excited to put out there. For example, during the entirely of our relationship, my wife and I have kept up a Bad Romance Book Club in which we read and discuss 30-40 year old bodice rippers, and it’s been such a good time that I thought it would be fun to condense the experience into a blog series.

I’ll also be periodically reviewing selections from the absurdly large collection of used books which I’ve amassed over the years. Ever heard of Closed System by Zach Hughes? What about Dinosaur Planet Survivors by Anne McCaffrey? Neither had I! But browsing Bookman’s and picking old sci-fi/fantasy novels based on the merits of their cover art breeds strange bedfellows. No best-sellers here, folks, just old, obscure titles which happen to look pretty dang good on a shelf. 

Finally, I’ll be giving weekly (or close enough to it) updates about my writing. This is one of those things which I’m secretly hoping becomes an artifact with time. Like, think of your favorite book. Wouldn’t it be neat to have a record of what the author was thinking when he wrote your favorite scene? Again, I’m probably getting ahead of myself with this one by presupposing that I’ll ever actually write a book that anyone cares about enough to go back and retroactively follow its development week to week. At the very least, it’s something which I’d like to have for myself. 

By now, you’re probably thinking that this isn’t typically the sort of blog which you’d expect to find on an author’s website, but that’s kind of what I’m going for. In conceptualizing (and justifying) my approach to Saving Game Night, I thought a lot about how I’ve interacted with Youtube content over the years. Usually, I’ll stumble across a video from someone I haven’t heard of and, if I like it, I’ll go back and binge a ton of their old stuff. Then, usually, I subscribe, and that Youtuber has gained themselves a new fan. Why don’t authors do this? If I ever publish a book and, by some miracle, gain an audience, I want there to be a backlog of content which people can go back and read. Something, anything which can keep their spark of interest in me and my writing alive past the moment when they put my book down would be a win for me. 

I’ve always understood things through stories. When I was a teenager, I would look at other kids talking and forming relationships and wonder how they made it look so easy. For me, books provided a place where I could create models to understand the world and the human connections that I so desperately wanted for myself. My favorite books were life-altering experiences. They allowed me to feel emotions which the real world seemed intent on denying me. Things like triumph, confidence, and even heartbreak seemed so out of reach back then. At a time when I was still unsure of who I really was, I pieced myself together with scraps of Rand al’Thor, Kelsier, Wil Ohmsford, Seoman Snowlock, Edward Elric, Himura Kenshin, and dozens more like them. Other people, I’m told, did not need to do it this way, but I did. 

As a writer, I have no delusions of destiny. No one would be more shocked than I if one of my books managed to get me a panel at a convention which people actually came to see. As much as I would love to write something that touches millions the way that my favorite stories have always touched me, the truth is that I simply cannot imagine such a thing ever happening. Most likely, it won’t. 

A few months ago, I read a 14 chapter manga called Time Paradox Ghost Writer about a guy who’s trying to sell a comic to Shonen Jump but is constantly rejected. In attempting to write a story for everyone, he creates stories for no one. The last chapter sees him experience an epiphany. He says, “As long as someone else out there in the world gets it, even if \[we’re] just two of a kind, wouldn’t that be a great stroke of luck?” 

So there it is. That’s why I write. I can’t be Robert Jordan, but maybe there’s a chance that I can be someone’s Robert Jordan, someone’s Brandon Sanderson, someone’s (insert favorite author here). 

So… 

Whoever you are… 

Welcome to Saving Game Night.
