And just like that, no sooner was it begun than my weekly update became a bi-monthly update. I can only imagine the rage and frustration my imaginary audience must feel at having been denied their promised glimpse behind the curtain of a book which will likely never see the light of day. 

In a way, this blog is my own personal flea circus. A few times, I’ve stopped mid-post to ask myself, “Is it actually okay for me to say this?” What an imagination us writers have! Often writers choose to put this talent to use by imagining themselves to be very smart or very important. \*cough\* Terry Goodkind \*cough\* I pick on Terry because he’s an easy target. Everyone does it. The reality is that most of the people I shared my undergraduate English education with fit this bill to the T. 

Me? I probably suffer from this. I think it would be hubris to say that I don’t exhibit any signs of the megalomania which so often afflicts writers (Reading that last sentence back, I rescind my previous statement. I definitely suffer from this). However, for writers like me for whom the word “obscure” is an overstatement, imagining an audience is a necessity. Hence the comparison to a flea circus. 

This week I was working on Kabakra Chapter 14. In case Kabakra is ever published and the chapters are moved around in the editing state, it’s the scene where Vivi takes Rylynn to the Grave of Ashes to see the bell. She also recites to him the mythology behind Amenestra’s founding. 

As a whole, I think it went alright. I’m a huge fan of long-winded mythology dumps and have been ever since Robert Jordan captivated me with Moiraine’s retelling of the epic history of Manatheran in The Eye of the World. I just think they’re really cool. As a writer, it gives me the opportunity to adopt a different voice and try my hand at the verbal storytelling tradition from which the fantasy genre descends.

At one point, the protagonist of the myth just whips out his sword and starts whacking arrows out of the sky, and I just handwave it by splicing in a note saying that he was skilled with the blade. Then his companion is hit and he takes her in his arms and they have a full conversation. It’s one of those scenes which totally falls apart if you try to think about it. Aren’t they surrounded by a hail of arrows? Why wasn’t his skill with the sword mentioned before? Seems convenient, doesn’t it? Scenes like this are all over old-timey stories. In the middle of the action, a character can just step outside reality and have a monologue or something. 

I think when we look at storytelling, we have a tendency to affix such tight rules to it. We want to distill it to a science. We place all this value on realism and continuity, and yet we have thousands of years of stories which do not play by those rules. The Iliad rules, and yet it bears very little similarity to what we would today consider a “good” story. Indulging in a little rule breaking during my short pastiche was a delight. 

Another Week, Another Rant 

As if it isn’t totally obvious, I’ve been on a bit of a Gundam kick recently. This might lead you to believe that I’m actually watching a lot of Gundam. Tsk tsk. Actually, I’m crawling my way through Zeta Gundam at the brisk pace of about 4 episodes a week. As usual, my meta-knowledge of something that I love has quickly outpaced my actual consumption. 

This week, I stumbled upon an article about the new Hathaway’s Flash movie which just came out. It was a great read, full of quotes from the director and other stuff which you don’t normally get from anime journalism. All the better that it confirmed some long-held suspicions I’ve had about the current anime industry, namely that nobody knows how to animate robots anymore. 

Okay, so that’s not entirely true, and the article is careful to say as much, but seriously. This is anime we’re talking about. It was literally built on the back of Gundam, reinvented by Neon Genesis Evangelion, and then (insert appropriate verb here) by Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann. Mecha is as much a part of anime as McDonalds is to American history, but in the year 2021, a studio like Sunrise (AKA THE mecha studio) can’t find inbetween animators who know how to draw robots and are forced to make all the mechs in Hathaway’s Flash 3DCG. 

Literally how does this happen??? 

Actually, now that I think about it, there’s definitely precident for knowledge like this going extinct in the anime industry. Take what happened with the advent of digital animation, for example. In the 80s and 90s, animators working on cels were producing stunning animation. They’d basically perfected their craft and then, BOOM, digital animation is introduced. Suddenly, everyone is drawing on computers. Techniques which animators had been perfecting since the dawn of anime were suddenly irrelevant. It’s no surprise that stuff from this period largely does not hold up. Now, computers are a bigger part of the animation process than ever. That old aesthetic is dead, and not just that, but the old masters are slowly dying off.

This is what’s so distressing about the robots on Hathaway’s Flash being CG. It’s one thing if people are animating in CG because they choose to. It’s another if they’re doing it by default, because the knowledge of any other way has literally been allowed to fade from existence. 

How long until stuff like AKIRA, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis Evangelion become post-apocalyptic relics like the F-16s in Battlefield Earth? Sure, they still exist, but only as reminders of what was once possible but now is not. We can return to them whenever we want, but without the sobering knowledge that their likes will never be seen again. 

The obvious counterpoint is that new stuff is always coming out which could never have been possible in the past. That’s fine, but this is like when people argue that we don’t need to worry about extinction rates in the biosphere because new species are still being discovered all the time. Innovation is natural. Anime is always changing. Every medium is. But does that mean that we have to literally just forget how to make the old stuff? A modern filmmaker, if they wanted to, could make a movie in the style of a 1950’s comedy. They have the tools, and they know the techniques. On the flip side, we will never see another Ghost in the Shell again, and the last fully 2D robot show is probably only a decade or so from airing. After that, even if someone wanted to make a show like that, they wouldn’t be able to.  

And that’s just too bad.
