Okay, so I’m already breaking my promise a little bit. In my defense, Dragonsbane isn’t exactly a best-seller, but it is not nearly so obscure as some of the other books on my shelf. It’s 3.95 star rating on Goodreads is based on more than 6,000 ratings. In the fantasy world, that’s a respectable number. Heck, The Witchwood Crown, Tad Williams’s stellar follow-up to his absolutely seminal Memory, Sorrow, Thorn trilogy, only has about 3,500. 

Unrelated, The Selection, a YA novel which asks, “What if The Bachelor, but set in one of those poorly considered YA dystopias that are all the rage these days?” has over 1 million ratings.

But I digress. 

In high school, I was a devout fan of Brandon Sanderson, so when I read on his website that the first fantasy book he ever read was Barbara Hambley’s Dragonsbane, I took my dad’s truck down to Bookmans in Mesa, Arizona and managed to locate a copy which proceeded to sit untouched for twelve years. 

However, I admit that I’m glad that I didn’t read Dragonsbane as a teenager. It’s like, did you ever have that moment when you didn’t like something because it looked old, only to grow up and realize that it’s actually totally awesome and you were just a dumb kid? Like, I remember liking the aesthetic of the Evangelion Rebuild movies more than the original show. I also remember thinking Gurren Lagann was dumb because it was too cartoony. I was an idiot. That’s what I’m getting at here. And idiot Malcolm wouldn’t have appreciated Dragonsbane. 

After all, it wasn’t for nothing that the book languished, unread, for more than a decade. Mind you, when I first bought the book, I was reading 250 pages a day MINIMUM. Most nights, around 8pm, I would retire to my room, turn the radio AM 620 where Arizona sports were broadcast, and read anywhere from four to six hours before shutting off the lights. At that time of my life, I could have finished Dragonsbane in two days, easily. 

So why didn’t I? 

On some level, I think it was because, at a superficial level, Dragonsbane appears to be a fairly generic fantasy, by which I mean that there is a dragon to be slain, an evil sorceress to defeat, and a fairly grounded European inspired setting.

Boooooooooorrriiiiiiiiinnnnnng. 

Ironically, I partially blame Brandon Sanderson for this. In my early teens, I’d read several older fantasy series, stuff like the Belgariad and Lord of the Rings, and enjoyed them just fine. I think it was somewhere after reading Mistborn (all 3), Elantris, and Warbreaker in quick succession that I began to lose patience with anything lacking a thoroughly explained magic system and hundred page Dickensian climaxes. I wanted big, new, fast, and exciting. I wanted dudes with iron spikes shoved through their eyes flying around a gothic landscape while dual weilding axes. I wanted guys with giant swords running on ceilings. I wanted that GOOD STUFF. 

Not that that stuff is bad. I’m only saying that for me, it was like candy. Once I had a taste, it was all I wanted, and I forgot that a humble roast could be just as delicious. 

I mention all this because Dragonsbane is a book which is sooooo much more than the sum of its parts, and in being that, I think it’s one which might be easily misunderstood, especially by newer fantasy readers. 

The story of Dragonsbane begins when our protagonist, Jenny, rescues a young man named Gareth from a pack of bandits. Gareth is searching for the legendary Dragonsbane, John Aversin, in hopes that he will agree to slay a dragon that is threatening his homeland. Jenny, as it turns out, is Aversin’s lover and the mother of his two sons. She is also a mage of meager abilities who is haunted by the thought that her family life has stunted her magical growth. She loves John and her sons, but she cannot look at them without wondering how powerful she might become were she but capable of cutting them loose. 

Jenny is an awesome character, one of the best that I’ve encountered in recent memory, and the story is carefully crafted to explore her in fascinating depth. The villain of the story is Zyerne, a young woman who represents everything which Jenny desires. She is young, beautiful, and (most importantly) vastly powerful. As Jenny observes and interacts with Zyerne, we are privy to her thoughts and, shrewdly, Barbara Hambley allows Jenny to struggle with herself. Though Zyerne is cruel and selfish, Jenny envies her. We see how insecure Jenny is, how bitter and petty she can be. 

So yeah, Jenny is going through a bit of a mid-life crisis, and it’s a character arc so underutilized in fantasy that it still feels fresh nearly forty years later. Maybe I just haven’t read enough 80’s fantasy, but this level of maturity was certainly not what I was expecting. 

Something else I want to comment on is the use of subversion in Dragonsbane. Hambley is obviously well versed in fantasy tropes and plays with them constantly. The character Gareth was obviously constructed for this purpose. For lack of a better word, he’s a fanboy. He’s read all the ballads and the legends about dragons and dragonsbanes, and it is against his fantastical expectations that the reality of slaying a dragon is contrasted. He is appalled to learn that John killed his dragon, not with a sword, but with a poisoned spear—a method which Gareth decries as dishonorable. John also wears glasses, shoots the shiz with pig farmers, patrols his own land, and in general, doesn’t meet Gareth’s lofty ideal of a hero at all. 

But here’s the twist. John is awesome. Despite his grisly methods, John is still the only man alive capable of killing a dragon. Though completely outmatched in terms of power, he stands up to Zyerne and resists her attempts to seduce him and then to intimidate him. At one point, Jenny and John sneak into the palace gardens. John drops off the top of the wall and Jenny remarks that “she felt John land on the ground below more than she heard him.”  

Severely cool. 

So why am I making such a big deal out of this? 

Recently, I watched the first episode of Loki and grew very sad at the scene where Loki finds a deskworker’s drawer filled with infinity stones. “Some of the guys use them as paperweights,” remarks the worker to an obviously shaken Loki. And why shouldn’t he be shaken? For ten years, Marvel built up the Infinity Stones. Whenever an Infinity Stone  showed up, it was an occurrence of world-shattering magnitude. Now, they’re paperweights. And why? Because some hack writer thought, “You know that thing that everyone thinks is awesome? What if… wait for it… it wasn’t awesome?! Ha-HA!” 

Blech. 

What was that one quote from that one movie by the one super talented guy? “Making something disappear isn’t enough. You have to bring it back.” 

Dragonsbane is subversive, but in a way which is refreshingly optimistic. “Real life isn’t like the stories,” Hambley seems to say, “It’s better.” Nowhere is this more true than in the relationship between John and Jenny. Their love isn’t sappy. It isn’t Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (I love all those movies, btw), but neither is it cynical. It’s mature and honest, and in being that, it is often stirringly beautiful and gave me several moments of deep, real romance that I never could have expected when picking this book up. 

Bravo, Barbara. Bravo. 

The last thing I want to highlight before wrapping this up is an interesting parallel that I noticed between Dragonsbane and the work of Brandon Sanderson. As I mentioned at the beginning, Dragonsbane is the book which got Brandon hooked on fantasy, and so I thought it interesting that—while Hambley’s magic is definitely soft—the one rule it has is that all magic must have Limitations.

Anyone familiar with Brandon Sanderson can probably see where I’m going with this. 

Sanderson’s 3 Laws of Magic. The Second Law: Limitations>Powers. Basically, a magic system is only as good as its limitations. While I hesitate to claim that Dragonsbane had any direct influence on Brandon as he was formulating his Laws, I did think this similarity between his now famous philosophy and that of his first fantasy novel worthy of note. 

So now we come to the end. As much as I’d like to nerd out about how much I love Barbara Hambly’s prose, I saw enough complaints about it on Goodreads to know that well-crafted descriptions aren’t exactly everybody’s cup of tea. Maybe I’m just out of the loop with modern fantasy—on second thought, I definitely am—but I don’t know where Dragonsbane gets published in 2021. I loved the book, but as I read it, I couldn’t help but lament the apparent dichotomy of art-fantasy and epic-fantasy that seems to have sprung up in recent years. 

Where has the middle-class of fantasy gone? Where is the niche for a simple, adventure story built around a strong central character? Michael J. Sullivan seems to have broken through, but only after becoming a hugely successful self-published author first. And this isn't even to mention that if Dragonsbane came out in 2021, it wouldn't have been given one of the coolest covers of all time, painted in mind-numbing detail because it came out in a time when excellence was the standard. 

In short, Dragonsbane made me miss the 80’s. 

I was born in 1992. 

See you next time.
