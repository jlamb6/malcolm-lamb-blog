  about my relationship with a game I've never finished. "

I﻿'m back baby! I've had all sorts of idea for blog posts over the last 2 (Jeez, it really has been almost two years now hasn't it?) years, but I never got around to them for a couple of reasons. First, I wanted to put together some really great posts, so I would take note of my idea and tell myself I would come back later to flesh it out, organize it, put it through a few drafts, and make something awesome. Nope. Just today, I was reading the old Pitchfork articles on socksmakepeoplesexy.net and feeling incredibly jealous because Pat is such a gifted writer, and he has been for quite some time. If my sense of the timeline is correct, he wrote those Final Fantasy articles that I love so much in his early twenties! Crazy. Anyway, in my dreams, my blog posts always come out like his. Instead, they don't come out at all. So I'm scrapping my delusions of building a backlog of eminently rereadable articles in exchange for just getting my thoughts out. Secondly, I realized that I've always seen this blog as secondary to my other writing. It felt irresponsible to spend time writing a blog post when I hadn't written part of my book that day, so I didn't. That's out the window too. It's getting close to 10pm right now and I have a LOT of personal writing left to do, and I'm cranking this out first. 

W﻿hy? 

B﻿ecause I was listening to a Final Fantasy playlist to help me focus at work, and "Lowtown" from Final Fantasy XII came on. Instantly, my head shot up, the glaze from hours of repetitive movement disappeared from my eyes, and I tabbed over to see what it was I was listening to exactly. You know how when you work or study or read with music on, the music just kind of becomes white noise? That's where I was, and then, all of the sudden, I was aware again. 

"Lowtown" is a track which just absolutely buzzes with energy. It's the song that plays when you're in Rabanastre, the game's starting area, and it gives off a vibe that's at once routine and filled with the promise of adventure. It's like if you took the big, epic orchestral track that would play as our characters march towards their destiny in a climactic moment and turned down the dial just a few notches. The spirit is there, but it's less, and it captures this infections sense of excitement, like that every day has the potential to turn into an adventure. Magic. 

S﻿o I tab over, and immediately I'm hit right in the face with this incredible piece of Final Fantasy XII artwork, and it just all comes back. Final Fantasy XII was the first game I was ever dying to play. Somewhere around 2007 or 2008 I remember seeing an ad for it in a magazine, the old box art showing the Judge rendered in that painterly style with a brushstroke of orange on the right side. Whenever I wonder why Final Fantasy continues to be popular even though there hasn't been a good game in more than a decade, I remember my reaction to that image. Knowing nothing else about the game, I knew I needed to play it.

S﻿ome time later, as the fam and I were getting set to move to Panama, a good friend of mine gave me his PS2 as a going away gift, and I immediately went to the used games rack at Gamestop and picked up a copy of Final Fantasy XII. It was on, baby. This was officially happening. 

O﻿nly . . . not really. I don't remember when exactly I first first up FFXII, but I do know that when I left home a year and a half later, I had not yet finished the game. I know I was in some dungeon with stone staircases where everything was green. At least that's what I remember. So as a teenager, I never finished it. And yet the game continued to have this weird hold over me. During the following years, I would often seek out reviews of the game to hear others talk about it, and Akihiko Yoshida's amazing art always had a funny way of ending up as my wallpaper from time to time. When I heard that The Zodiac Age was coming out in 2017, I knew it was time. So I bought it for my PS4 and . . . returned it some time afterwards having barely played any of it. Huh. 

A﻿ few years later, I bought the game AGAIN when it came out for the Switch. This attempt when better than the last one, and I did end up making it about 15-20 hours into the game, but again, I left the game unfinished. Every now and then, I fire up my Switch and there, at the far right of my menu, is Final Fantasy XII, and every time I see it, that little square of Akihiko Yoshida artwork stirs something inside me. "I should get back to it. Just put an hour in or so to prime the pump." 

T﻿he unfortunate issue is that FFXII isn't exactly that fun to play. The art is amazing, even rendered in game (though the cutscenes definitely bore me more now than they did as a teenager when I thought they were the most mindblowing things in the world. I even remember showing them to my friends, context-free, like "See! Look how cool this is!" and then feeling genuinely hurt by their looks of bewilderment) but the Gambit system doesn't really do it for me, and after playing games like Chrono Trigger and Chained Echoes, I think I just ask a little more from my JRPG combat that Final Fantasy XII and it's flashy CGI super attack spamming battles can give me.

A﻿nd yet still, when I heard "Lowtown" today, and saw that art, I was fifteen again, in my brother's room, sitting cross legged on the floor with a gaming magazing open in front of me. Will I play Final Fantasy XII this week? I might. Will I finish it? I hope to, one day. I think I have to before I die, honestly. Will I enjoy it? Ehhhhhh . . . who knows. Probably not enough. Will I love it forever? Yeah, I think so. 

F﻿inal Fantasy XII is just one of those things for me. I think we all have them. Towards the end of Makoto Shinkai's "Your Name," the main guy, Taki, finds himself drawn to images of the town Itomori, which three years earlier was destroyed by a falling comet, and wondering to himself, "Why does scenery from a town which no longer exists wring my heart so?" What Taki doesn't remember is that he spent the entire movie switching bodies with and falling in love with a girl in Itomori named Mitsuha. But even though he's forgotten, his heart responds. 

I﻿t's a fact that most of us have forgotten most of our lives. What we remember are only slivers. We see our past through the spaces in a picket fence, but everywhere, there are clues pointing to experiences we've had, people we've met, and emotions we've felt. Our hearts remember what our heads have long forgotten, and they reach for that which they cannot grasp. 

Why do images and sounds from a game I've never finished wring my heart so? Maybe in the next life, I'll know for sure. Until then, I can appreciate these stirrings inside for what they are, evidences of a life that has been more full than I'll ever be able to understand.
