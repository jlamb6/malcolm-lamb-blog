  Always Judge a Book by It's Cover. We have no one to blame but ourselves. "

What an absolute letdown. But then again, whose fault could it be but our own? After all, it was us who decided to break our rule about only reading romance books with good covers. And after I ranted so thoroughly in favor of the old, painterly, bosoms a-flopping, magic blouse covers of yonder days in my review of A Pirate’s Pleasure! Truly, we have no one to blame but ourselves. 



The Marriage Test actually started out pretty strong. The first chapter showed us two knights reduced to orgasmic convultions from the taste of our heroine’s meat pies. The second it happened, my wife turned to me and said it reminded her of that anime I told her about one time. 



Funny how great minds think alike. 



Shokugeki no Souma (or Food Wars for you plebs) is an anime based around the premise that enemies can be cooked into submission by being involuntarily subjected to bouts of ecstasy from the taste of food. A romance novel based around a similar concept seemed destined to be legendary.

Unfortunately, The Marriage Test does very little with its awesome central concept. After that first chapter, foodgasms are pretty hard to come by, and the story instead choses to focus on the absolutely terrible relationship between Main Girl and Main Guy, and if you think I’m going to spend even a second of my life relearning their names then you’ve vastly underestimated the value of my time.  



Ahhh… Main Guy. 



Do you remember the Silver Hawk, hero of A Pirate’s Pleasure? Now there was a man. Strong, confident, alpha in the extreme. Questionable seduction practices aside (though this is debatable), he’s the ideal lead for a good bodice ripper. In contrast, the Marriage Test’s romantic interest is a duke whose sense of smell is so powerful that he has to wear a clothespin over his nose at all times to avoid passing out. 



This is one of those ideas that’s so obviously terrible that you’ve got to wonder how it got past the editor. 



In case you don’t get what I mean, let me be more clear: 



Ahem. 



IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE ATTRACTED TO A MAN WHO WEARS A CLOTHESPIN OVER HIS NOSE AT ALL TIMES. Full stop. The only thing that might have been less sexy is if he’d been like Señor Pink from One Piece and dressed like a baby. I cannot emphasize how much of a deal breaker this was. 



Okay, so there’s a kernel of a good idea here. I’ll give the auther that much credit. The idea that Main Guy’s sense of smell is so powerful that all food is disgusting to him except for whatever our Main Girl cooks up is pretty clever. It’s a fun idea, and combined with the foodgasm concept could have turned out hilarious and awesome. 



But it isn’t. Not even close. Despite the ridiculous premise, Betina Krahn (I looked up the author’s name just now) always plays it low-key. The story and situations are painfully grounded and boring which wouldn’t normally be a problem except for that the premise allows for so much more! Like, just a little more creativity could have actually made something memorable out of this, but as it stands, The Marriage Test is a shining example of how good execution trumps good ideas every time. 



You’re not interested, but in case you are, here’s a quick breakdown of the plot. 



Main Guy eats Main Girl’s cooking and decides that he has to have her as his chef. The convent doesn’t want to let her go (because of her skillz in the kitchen), but a deal is struck that Main Girl can serve as Main Guy’s cook for a year but must be returned to the convent with her virginity intact. Here’s the catch, Main Girl doesn’t want to go back to the convent. She wants a man, and she’ll cook up whatever she has to to get one. Now throw in the fact that this is a world where eating induces raging levels of sexual arousal and weep at what might have been. 



Even as I write it out, better plots populate my mind with the speed and tenacity of mobile game ads on illegal streaming sites. It’s a premise so juicy that we ignored the lackluster cover and purchased two copies for 4.50 each (astronomical prices, I might add, for a used book store. The place we go to usually sells them for a dollar). 



Like I said, it’s our own fault. 



Tragic. An utter disappointment. Worse than the Star Wars Prequels? Probably not. Worse than ebola? I’ll get back to you on that one.  



1/10.
