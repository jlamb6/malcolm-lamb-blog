  a relatively obscure anime Youtuber on this blog. "

So this last week I was engaging in what has quickly become a complicated pastime for me. I refer to my tendency of late to revisit old Digibro content. Digibro, for anyone who doesn’t know, was an anime youtuber who is singlehandedly responsible for getting me back into anime after I took a nearly 4 year hiatus from the medium between 2011 and 2015. Heck, forget David Stern vetoing the Chris Paul trade; the greatest sliding doors moment of the 2010’s came when I got 10 minutes into “The Irregular at Magic High School” and nearly gave up anime forever. 

The Digibro youtube channel is dead now, but his videos are still available on archive channels across the platform. These videos number in the THOUSANDS and they do not even include the Let’s Play videos he made with his brother which account for dozens, if not HUNDREDS, of hours of additional content.

For a period of about 4 years, Digibro released a video a week on his main channel and many more on his side channel, Digibro After Dark. I watched every single one. I was as die hard a fan as they come, and yet here I am, some six months after the death of the Digibro channel, and hardly a week goes by that I don’t uncover some piece of Digibro content which I wasn’t familiar with. Heck, before he transitioned to youtube, Digibro ran an anime blog for 8 years, and I’ve probably only read 1% of his posts. 

(Note: Just this morning I discovered not one but TWO more old blogs of his. The well never ends)

So why am I talking about this? In a way, I think I’m trying to turn back the clock. No, that’s not quite right. I think if I’m being honest then what I’m doing is more akin to reanimating a corpse. Digibro doesn’t exist anymore, but I can go back and stick some electrodes in his neck, and he’ll talk to me when I push play. What does this do for me? Why am I doing this to myself? I’m not sure I could tell you. 

Today, I was reading a blog post from 2012 where then-Digitalboy eulogizes the end of an anime blog which had a profound impact on him. He was, in essence, doing something like what I’m doing now. 

It’s strange, going back. In a way, it reminds me of the time I visited the ruins at El Tajin in Mexico. “We’re walking where the ancients walked,” commented one of my travel companions. As I go through Digibro’s archives, I’m not walking, and it’s certainly not ancient, but what’s the difference between yesterday and a thousand years ago when they’re both equally out of reach? 

I envy Digibro. I’m writing this right now, and chances are that no more than a dozen pairs of eyes will ever read it. Digibro had an audience of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions. He singlehandedly changed the way that anime is discussed here in America in ways that most casual fans probably don’t even notice. 

As time goes by, fewer and fewer people will remember that he was the one who first pointed out that the conversation about anime budgets was broken or that Sword Art Online actually sucked or that Yu Yu Hakusho totally holds up or that K-On!! Is good and not moe-blob trash (which is what I thought circa 2010). None of these are controversial takes anymore, largely thanks to this guy. 

There’s something both humbling and inspiring about the sheer amount of content which was produced under the Digi persona. Could I ever stop caring? I don’t know. I wonder sometimes if I might be the only person left crazy enough to spend hours at work relistening to Digi’s old videos while also doing archeological work on his blogs, trying to uncover the entirety of his internet presence over the last 15+ years.  

I think there’s a part of me which wants to think that one day someone will want to do the same for me. In part, that’s the reason this blog exists in the first place. To give anyone interested material to dive into because they think I’m interesting or because I see things in a way which connects with them as deeply as Digibro’s perspective connected with me. 

To most people, Digibro is nobody. Most likely, that’s all I’ll ever be as well. Aspirations of becoming the next Robert Jordan or Brandon Sanderson or George R.R. Martin or even the next Digibro are just that. Success is the culmination of a million things. Most creatives don’t make it. The market is only becoming more saturated with writers who are more talented than ever. In the vast landscape, a novel like Kabakra might as well be a grain of sand on the beach. The best I can hope for is that it’ll stick to someone’s flip flop rather than being washed out to sea.
