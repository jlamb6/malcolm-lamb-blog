So, even though this is the first update on Kabakra, I’m about 50k words into the book already. Last year, I wrote 200k words of a book called Kitsune which was my first attempt at a novel since high school. Kabakra is the second, which means that it should be better than Kitsune, right? 

Maybe? 

For a book that I’m hoping to polish into something theoretically publishable in the next year, my feelings on Kabakra’s progress are pretty mixed. On the one hand, I think the pacing is head and shoulders better than my previous effort. This is partly a result of having put together a more complete outline to work from. But it’s not all good news. For whatever reason, I’m really struggling with characterization in Kabakra. Just this last week, I was putting together my submission to Brandon Sanderson’s writing class. I went back to Kabakra Chapter 1 and was just shocked at how watered down Rylynn’s character had become. The character I was writing in chapter 13 this week wasn’t even the same person as the guy from chapter 1. The same goes for Vivi, the only other character to appear consistently across that time. Originally fun, flirtatious, mysterious, now she’s just some girl. Ugh. 

For whatever reason, I didn’t struggle with this in Kitsune. My characters stayed (somewhat) consistent, and I wonder if that’s in part because Kabakra has so much more dialogue (read: exposition). Kitsune was a lot more atmospheric and introspective and prose driven. Way more of the book happened inside the characters’ heads and dialogue was sparse and focused so as to communicate character/relationships. Plot was largely handled outside of dialogue. This is an approach that I’ve gotten away from with Kabakra. Because of this, dialogue now has to balance forwarding the plot with developing character. 

If I sound frustrated by this, it’s because I am. There’s nothing worse—NOTHING—than going back to your old writing and realizing that it’s better than your new stuff. 

Hopefully, it’s something I can correct going forward or at least smooth over during the second draft. 

**This Week’s Rant Topic iiiiiiiissssssss…** 

I’ve ruined myself for modern anime. I really have. This week, as the morning air grew nippy and the last vestiges of summer officially withered away, I became vaguely aware that the Fall season of anime was probably getting underway. I’ve never really been into watching seasonal anime, but whenever the new season starts I’ll usually click through a few episodes of whatever shows seem most promising/popular, just to get a sense of the state of anime. 

These are rarely encouraging experiences. 

This time, the flagellation was delivered courtesy of A1 Pictures’s latest light novel adaptation, 86, whose second season just started airing.

Do you ever drive down the road and think to yourself, “Jeez, all these cars are friggin ugly”? Probably not. Because you’re used to the way that cars look. I know I sure am. 99 days out of 100, that thought never crosses my mind. But every now and then the wife and I will watch an old movie, and I’ll watch Cary Grant stroll down the streets of New York and be reminded that there was a time when cars just kinda looked awesome all the time.  

So I’m clicking through the first episode of 86, season 2, and all the while I can’t stop thinking about Zeta Gundam.

I’m no animation expert, but I’m sure that someone who was could tell me all the reasons why 86 is better animated than Zeta Gundam, a show which is somewhere around 35 years old now. But like, who freaking cares? 86 may be better animated. Things may move around more and the characters might be more expressive, but I don’t want to look at it! Meanwhile, I would watch a 24 minute slideshow made up entirely of still shots from Zeta Gundam and come away feeling pretty great. 

As I’m having this experience, I come across this quote from Yoshiyuki Tomino, the creator of Gundam. 

“There are so many cars in the streets, yet there is no enjoyment in watching them anymore. That’s a terrible thing, isn’t it” 

Yes. Yes it is.
