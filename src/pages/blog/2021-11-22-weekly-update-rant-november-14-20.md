As soon as I’m done writing this, I’m going to finish Chapter 17 of Kabakra. As of yet, I’m still on pace to end Part 2 around chapter 20. So, what are my thoughts? I was somewhat happy with part 1. Rylynn’s big realization in the fight with Tellinor was a little messy and will definitely need fixing, but other than that, I think it turned out alright and is certainly the most complete arc I’ve written in any story so far. 

Part 2 I’m much less confident in. I can’t stop second guessing my decision to change Rylynn’s initial encounter with Lemnas Grawn from watching him brutalize his opponent in the Kabakra to seeing him training at Master Thyse’s forge. On the one hand, the new version accomplishes things that the other could not. Rylynn receiving the healing bandage from Mistress Thyse, for example. But I feel like it just lacks the impact of my original idea. Also, while most of Tellinor’s build-up involved Rylynn actually interacting with his foe, Lemnas Grawn has been a distant presence to say the least. Leading up to his match with Rylynn, he’s been on screen exactly twice. Once in that opening scene and once when Rylynn locks eyes with him in the scene at the White Temple (originally, Rylynn and Grawn were supposed to talk in this scene). 

So now I’m writing the scene where Rylynn learns the truth about Grawn’s past, why he’s in prison and why he’s participating in the Kabakra. But he has no relationship with this man. It’s frustrating. In another draft, I would like Grawn to be more of a character. We see how civil he is outside of the Kabakra contrasted with his rage in the arena. Rylynn confronts him, and we learn about Grawn’s character based on his reaction. 

I guess this is what first drafts are for, right? What’s 20,000 words of revisions in the scheme of things? Hopefully, I can take these lessons into part 3 and produce something that won’t require a massive overhaul before the final version. 

**This Week’s Rant: Ruminations on Tad Williams**

So I recently started Empire of Grass by Tad Williams, and I’m loving it. It’s nice because it gives me ideas for Kabakra, but it’s also a bummer because reading it makes me realize how much Kabakra sucks. Everything that I’m trying to do (somewhat realistic world with grounded characters and a slow-burning, introspective tone) Williams executes to perfection. It’s really quite astonishing. 

I think that Williams is criminally underrated as a worldbuilder. In part, I think it’s because so much about his world feels like “standard” fantasy. The Aedonite religion is pretty much just Christianity. The Sithi are elves, and the Hikeda’ya are dark elves. Most of the world is pretty much just medieval Europe, and there’s no magic system. But Osten Ard breathes. 

I think the reason for this is that Williams does such a good job of allowing us to perceive Osten Ard from the subjective experiences of the characters. In our modern world, we’ve got satellites and science and as much information as you can stomach. As a result, I think we tend to experience the world much, much more objectively than people once did. When this tendency slips into fantasy, it can make a setting feel inauthentic. There is nothing “gamey” about Osten Ard. It all feels organic, a true setting in that it’s a world where the plot takes place rather than a place which exists to facilitate the plot. 

People who like “gamey” settings tend to be the same type of people who are always asking questions like, “Why didn’t X character do this instead of that?” They’re the type of people that want their fantasy worlds to operate on a consistent logic which extends beyond the realm of “hard magic” and into the realm of character behavior. Never mind that behavior is often erratic and irrational. This is what I mean by “gamey.” In a game, certain actions always lead to certain outcomes. This is not the case with real life and real people.  

William’s characters never feel pre-programmed. That isn’t to say that they just act randomly, however. Their characters are clearly defined, and their actions always stem naturally from who they are. However, Williams seems to understand what many people do not, which is that human behavior is a spectrum. 

For example, I have a bit of a temper and I can be confrontational. However, say someone brings up a controversial opinion in my presence. If I started a heated discussion, that would be in character. However, repeat that same situation 10 times, and you might get that result only 7 times. The other 3 times I stay quiet for a variety of reasons. Does this make me inconsistent? No, it makes me human. 

Likewise, Williams’s characters always seem like they could react in any number of ways to their situations. It makes them feel alive because they don’t feel like they are being controlled, like they’re just pawns being manipulated in service of the narrative.
