I guess I should explain myself. On our first date, I took my wife to a book fair at Parque Retiro in Madrid. While we were browsing the booths, we came across a display of bodice rippers. After cracking a few jokes at the expense of heaving bosoms and brooding bachelors, we were chased away by a very passionate kiosk attendant who did not take kindly to our casual disparagement of her favorite literary genre. How insensitive we were. How ignorant. We scoffed. We brayed. We guffawed. 

And then, we considered. 

After all, neither of us had ever read a bodice ripper. Was it possible that our intolerance was rooted in ignorance? Were we shortsightedly denying ourselves the best that the age old tradition of written storytelling had to offer? We had to know. 

And so began a great experiment. Six books later, am I an expert on romance novels? Not exactly. But it’s been a good time. Sure, they are all mostly terrible, at least by the generally accepted standards of what constitutes a good book. But throw those aside, and what you find is a fascinating genre with its own rules and tropes and standards entirely foreign to most readers. 

Foreign. Let’s run with that. In Japan, slurping loudly is considered polite, as is burping in China, and I’ve yet to visit a Latin American country where calling someone fat is actually considered offensive. This is the lens through which we must view romance novels. If measured against a conventional stick, a book like A Pirate’s Pleasure is largely a disaster, and that’s most of the fun, but the rest comes from examining the weird and often highly specific ways that romance novels appeal to their audience. After all, these books sell millions of copies, and it’s not for nothing. People, like the woman at the kiosk, love this stuff. 

So. We arrive at A Pirate’s Pleasure by Heather Graham. And, I mean, just look at that cover. Behold the rolling bosoms and the physics defying architecture of a blouse which impossibly manages to conceal just enough to keep the book PG-13 when it should clearly be gathered around her waist. The Magic Shirt (a play on the Magic Skirt trope which so often shows up in anime and comics) is one of my favorite recurrent elements of romance covers, at least from the time before crappy photoshop art replaced the awesome, painted scenes of the 80’s and 90’s.

But I digress. 

This, ladies and gentleman, is Skye Kinsdale, and this is actually a somewhat accurate depiction of our feisty heroine. Bust, check. Red hair, check. Moving on. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Silver Hawk, the titular pirate whose pleasure is much less a factor than his anger, rage, frustration, and condescension. And just… look how they massacred my boy! The corny skull and crossbones tattoo? The eyepatch? THE SILVER HAWK DOESN’T WEAR AN EYEPATCH! He looks like a dang cartoon character. Where is the dignity? Perhaps they thought I would be too distracted by the grotesque bulge of his Adam's apple to realize that this stranger is most certainly not the Silver Hawk. 

Breathe, Malcolm. Breathe. 

Fun fact: Heather Graham was actually the first author that we read as part of our little book club. Her earlier novel, The Devil’s Mistress, is both a Jane Eyre ripoff featuring a crazy wife in the attic AND a crossover with The Crucible. Yes. You read that right. It’s also an absolute clinic on blurring the lines of consent (a recurring theme throughout the entire genre) during the \*cough cough\* encounters. What I mean to say is that we had pretty high hopes for A Pirate’s Pleasure and boy did it ever deliver. 

Scene 1: Roc Cameron, a wealthy southern landowner, is surveying his vast Carolina estate, brooding about his responsibility to pass on the family name, when an old friend, Theodore Kinsdale, comes to call. He bears a proposal, that Roc Cameron honor his parent’s vow that he would marry Theodore’s daughter, Skye. Theodore reveals that he has tricked Skye into signing the marriage papers. All that is left is for Roc to pen his name, and he will be a married man. Roc is initially hesitant, but his honor as a gentleman constricts him. He sees that he has no choice but to marry this girl against both her knowledge and wishes. 

Boom. One chapter in the bag, and our heroine is already married to a man she’s never met. As far as beginnings go, it’s fertile ground for drama. 

Scene 2: Skye Kinsdale crossing the Atlantic when, on a stormy night, lightning illuminates the faint outline of a vessel approaching through the distant fog. “Pirates. Damn Pirates,” someone whispers. Skye, being the willful heroine she is, refuses to take refuge below deck. Note: This is not the last time that Skye will exert herself this way. In her case, the description of “willful” is accurate, so long as it is followed by the word “endangerment.” Anywho. Pirates board the ship, and we learn that Skye has some skill with a sword. She kills a few scallywags, but is just about to fall when another pirate ship appears. 

Enter: The Silver Hawk, rugged champion, bearded Adonis, not-so-shameless Dread Pirate Roberts knock-off. Seriously, he dresses in all black, knee high boots, and is often referred to as the Dread Silver Hawk. The comically enormous plume in his pirate hat does little to conceal the influence, though it does often conceal his face, especially when Heather Graham needs to hide some potentially revealing expression which, if seen by Skye, might threaten to progress their relationship. 

But I’m getting ahead of myself. 

The Hawk’s crew makes quick work of the other pirates. The ship is his, but Skye refuses to be so easily taken. She challenges The Silver Hawk, and the two duel. At this point, we realize that we’ve been subjected to a compound Worf Effect (see here: <https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect>). You see, not only were the first batch of pirates only an excuse to showcase Skye’s competence with a blade but, unbeknownst to us, Skye herself was also being set up! The Hawk dismantles her with hardly a care.  It's Worf-ception! A Worf within a Worf! Crucially, much attention is paid to the unrelenting power of his sword strokes against which Skye is totally helpless because, you know, why even bother with nuance? 

So let’s talk about Skye. This except from a Goodreads review is very telling: 

“My only big complaint was the heroine, as she got on my nerves. She fought, complained and put herself in danger non-stop! She pulls so many stupid decisions. . .  This story would have been much better if only the heroine showed a bit of common sence.” 

There was a point where the hero slaps her down, something I should be appalled by, but oddly found myself cheering him on. How messed up is that?” 

Amen. I couldn’t agree more. My wife (whose tolerance for stupidity is tellingly less than my own) has brought up similar complaints with every romance we’ve read so far. A little bit of digging reveals that this is also, by far, the most common complaint in online reviews, genre-wide. 

In romance novels, the heroines are archetypically feminine, making most of their decisions based on emotion, while the bachelors (I hesitate to call them heroes) consistently confront their situations logically. They show flashes of intense emotion, but when the chips are down and there’s a butt to kick or a damsel to save, they never fail to think rationally. 

This leads to the phenomena mentioned in the above review. At various points in the main lovers’...uhhh… relationship, the Silver Hawk does the following: 

1. Threatens to beat Skye
2. Spanks Skye
3. Forcibly strips Skye
4. Threatens to rape Skye
5. Threatens to sell Skye as a sex slave

And that’s just what I remember off the top of my head. It’s a rap sheet more fitting of a Sword Art Online villain than a romantic lead, and yet, just as the above reviewer says, my wife and I found ourselves siding almost universally with the Hawk simply because Skye was so unbearable.

And what’s even more interesting? 

This appears to be all by design. 

Early on in our book club, we noticed a tendency for the sexual tension in a scene to increase proportional to the threat of violence posed by one of the leads. Usually it is the man, but sometimes the law is inverted. It’s sort of like that Hot/Crazy Matrix from How I Met Your Mother, only way weirder. 

This is what I mean when I say that you have to look at romance novels differently than you may other books. These are fantasy, pure fantasy. They are not meant to model real world relationships and their characters are not meant to act as real people. One might be tempted to call the story misogynistic if the authors, editors, and target audience were not so overwhelmingly female. 

Anyway, at this point, you may be asking yourself, “Wait, the book is called A Pirate’s Pleasure, isn’t it? If the Silver Hawk is the pirate, how does this Roc Cameron guy she’s married to fit into the picture?” 

Patience. Patience. All will be revealed in time. 

So Skye is now a prisoner aboard the Silver Hawk’s ship which is unfortunate because Skye is horribly prejudiced against pirates. This is to give her some generalized reason to hate the Hawk which will prove obstacle enough to allow Heather Graham to procrastinate Skye’s realization of love as long as possible. 

What follows is an odd dance. Consider the following pattern. 

* Skye expresses a need
* The Silver Hawk fills that need 
* Skye says she wishes he were dead
* The Silver Hawk takes affront and either storms out or commits one of the above offenses
* Skye gets scared of the dark. This is a very important aspect of her character. 
* The Silver Hawk holds her until she falls asleep
* Repeat 

Along the way, Skye constantly disobeys the Hawk’s totally reasonable demands, and her actions lead to several deaths among the Silver Hawk’s crew for which she suffers no consequences and from which she learns no lessons. These mistakes are laid at the feet of her “courage” and “willfulness” and ultimately come off like a strange sort of compliment. Sort of like, “If only you weren’t so awesome and stunningly beautiful and brave and courageous then (insert tragedy here) would not have happened,” with the implication seeming to be that any amount of male lives sacrificed is a small price to pay for a great woman. 

Note: As you can see, trying to disentangle the messaging of these books is a futile endeavor, but noticing the weird contradictions is part of the fun! 

Throughout the journey, the passion between Skye and the Silver Hawk grows, with the Silver Hawk (of course) being the first to own the fact that he’s fallen for his prisoner. Skye can’t seem to get over that whole “I hate pirates and I wish you were dead” thing, even as she finds herself becoming more and more attracted to the Hawk. Literally, in one line she will think to herself that the Hawk is a singular and admirable man, a man of honor and integrity, and in the next tell him to his face that she wants to see him dance the gallows jig. It’s a jarring and frustrating experience to say the least. 

Things reach a breaking point when they make port at the Hawk’s private island, Bone Cay. Expecting a den of piracy, Skye is surprised to find a thriving, peaceful colony at Bone Cay. What more, her Irish handmaidens from the beginning of the book (Oh, did I forget to mention them? That’s alright. So did Heather Graham) actually weren’t horribly raped but instead treated with the utmost respect by the Silver Hawk’s crew. 

This is another of our favorite romance tropes. The heroine, usually burdened with some type of undeserved prejudice against the noble bachelor, is taken to some kind of home base where she sees that the people closest to the man all seem to esteem him very highly. This challenges her perception and usually ends in a glorious bang. 

And that’s exactly what happens. 

After seeing the happy people at Bone Cay, Skye realizes the depth of her feelings for the Hawk and decides that she must escape him once and for all. She cannot, despite all the times she said so, bear to see the pirate hang, something which she treats as an inevitability. Stealing into the stables, she takes a horse and flees. 

Note: Remember, Skye is on a small island in the Caribbean. The tendency to attempt escape when there is nowhere to run is unique to Skye, and it’s a move she pulls repeatedly throughout the book, the most hilarious example being when she tries to escape the Hawk’s ship… while it’s in the middle of the ocean. 

She charges across the island at full speed, ignoring the adoring locals who love and admire her as a friend of the Silver Hawk, until at last she arrives at an inland oasis. The stage is set. The sun shines hot, warming the sand beneath her feet, and a waterfall crests over a majestic rock outcropping, spilling into a crystalline lagoon. Then... 

BAM! 

The Silver Hawk, his tanned, pirate skin glistening, bursts out of the water like James Bond in Casino Royale only if James Bond was a sexy pirate instead of a sexy secret agent. They lock eyes. Neither one expected to find the other there, so their defenses are down. They’re vulnerable. The Hawk strides through the shallow water, wordless in his approach and then… 

Not once. 

Not twice. 

We thought three times would be enough, but we were wrong. 

Not four times. 

FIVE TIMES. 

Truly epic. A masterstroke. It’s the Big Bang (pun most definitely intended) of love scenes, an explosion which bursts outwards through space and time to provide the genesis of all eroticism depicted in literature throughout human history. 

Heather Graham, I bow before you. 

But the drama is only beginning, for the Silver Hawk has brought Skye to Bone Cay because it is there, in his keep, where he will meet with Roc Cameron to negotiate her return. They have only discovered love at the very moment in which it must end. Shakespearean stuff. 

Skye demands to attend the negotiations, but the Hawk refuses, and in fact, after returning to the keep, she does not see him again until already sailing away on Roc Cameron’s ship. Casting her gaze bay, Skye sees a long figure in black, the plume of his hat hung low to cover his face, standing tall atop the Silver Hawk’s docked vessel as she sails away. She can never love another man. 

Imagine her surprise, then, when later that evening she is informed by Roc Cameron that they are, in fact, married! Yes. Several reviews I read said that the second half of the book wasn’t as good as the first, but I emphatically disagree. This is where it starts to get really juicy and where Heather Graham reveals herself as an absolute madwoman. 

Impossibly, Skye begins to fall for Roc! He has the same silver eyes as his cousin (Oh yeah, he’s called the Silver Hawk because of the silver eyes which run in his family. Also, it’s established in the beginning that he and the Hawk are cousins. See? The drama thickens!) and the same masculine allure which she could not resist in the Hawk. 

But now Skye is left doubly conflicted. On the one hand, she resists her growing feelings for Roc out of anger at having been married off against her will, but also, she feels that loving him is a betrayal to the Silver Hawk. After all, it was the Silver Hawk who taught her to love in the first place. 

Just... Heather Graham. How do you come up with this stuff? Completely unironically, I have to say that this is legitimately a clever subversion of the usual “lady feels conflicted for feeling attracted to a guy that isn’t her husband” setup that happens all the time. Here, Skye is feeling guilty for being attracted to her husband! Credit where credit is due, and credit is definitely due. 

See this is the difference between a romance that sucks and one that doesn’t. How much thought was put into making the relationship dynamics between the leads as weird and convoluted as possible? Other books we’ve read \*cough\* Bold Destiny by Jane Feather \*cough\* are simply unimaginative with their scenarios. For Briley and I, this was a breath of fresh air. 

And that’s not even to mention that this is a legit love triangle in a genre that is strictly monogamous. And when I say “legit,” I mean it. We didn’t know what to make of Roc. At first, I thought he was going to be a vengeful husband, angry at the Hawk for defiling his bride, who keeps Skye hostage, forcing the Hawk to come rescue her. But then their relationship just kept developing. Flabbergasted, we watched as Roc matched the Hawk’s charm and roguish allure tit for tat. He even rode into a deep, dark forest to save Skye after she (wait for it) stole a horse and ran off to escape her growing feelings. There, in the night, she confides in him the secret behind her fear of the dark, something which she’d never told even the Silver Hawk. 

So naturally Roc gropes Skye in her sleep and, unable to tell dream from reality, Skye imagines she’s sleeping once again with the Silver Hawk, only to awake and have the Hawk’s image meld into that of Roc overtop her. But hey, what kind of romance would this be if there weren’t a little casual sexual assault sprinkled in to keep things fresh? 

Which leads us to the big twist. 

When Skye’s father is kidnapped by a pirate she’d antagonized earlier in the book, she decides that the Silver Hawk is her only hope to save her father. After seducing Roc, she knocks him out using a flawlessly executed “wine bottle over the head” technique, and runs off to solicit the pirate’s help. Only… 

Cut to Roc, groggily waking amidst spilt wine and broken glass. 

“Seems she got the better of you,” says Lieutenant Governor Spotswood. 

“Why?” 

“She’s gone to plead with the Silver Hawk to save her father. Perhaps you’ll be needing those whiskers of yours.” 

Whiskers? But Roc Cameron is clean shaven, a true gentleman of class and breeding, not like that rogue of a cousin of his, the Silver Hawk, whose thick, lush beard…. No… No, it can’t be… 

At first, we can’t believe it. My mouth hangs agape while flies enter and exit at will, commenting on the state of my molars as if touring an open house. Briley giggles uncontrollably, delighted by the surprise. Somewhere, far away, Heather Graham sneezes, smiles, and goes about her day. 

The Silver Hawk. 

Roc Cameron. 

They’re one and the same. 

Why wouldn’t the Hawk let Skye sit in on the negotiations? Why did Roc never allow Skye to see him naked? Why has the Hawk been so protective of her? Remember that one uncomfortable scene where Skye dreams she’s banging the Hawk but then, as she wakes, his image melds with that of Roc Cameron who is sexually assaulting her in her sleep?  

One by one, the puzzle pieces fall into place. 

M. Night. Shyamalan, eat your heart out. 

As for the ending, it’s pretty standard stuff. Roc is jealous that Skye has sought the help of another man, even though that other man is himself, and decides to rub it in her face by hiring a doxie to lounge half-naked beside him when she comes searching for the Hawk. Skye eventually finds out about the deception and is unnecessarily loud about it despite the fact that they are behind enemy lines in the villanous pirate’s turf. They are promptly captured and the Hawk bargains for Skye’s life at the cost of his own yada yada yada and it’s babies ever after in the epilogue. 

All in all, incredible stuff. A decent read, but a great memory, which is pretty much the best that can be said for a book in this genre. Sure, was Skye’s bravery/willfulness (read: stupidity)  used like the “ninjas appear out of nowhere” NaNoWriMo cheat to inject instant drama into the story when things started to get dull? Yes, it was and with complete indiscretion. But for all the cheap stuff, there was plenty which I hadn’t seen before. Unironically, the reveal about Roc and the Hawk being the same guy is the most I’ve been got by a plot twist in YEARS. Brandon Sanderson didn’t do it. Christopher Nolan didn’t do it. It was Heather Graham. 

And for that, I will gladly tip my cap.
